# Unity-Solana Wallet
The First Open-Source Unity-Solana Wallet with NFT support

The Unity-Solana Wallet is an essential bridge connecting game developers and the Solana blockchain. With Solanaâ€™s quick and low-cost transactions, games can start using blockchain technology like never before - in real-time. Thousands of developers will bring millions of players into the Solana ecosystem. This will, in turn, make the Solana projects benefit from an increased number of participants, and cross-protocol interoperability in games will take us beyond the current understanding of DeFi.  
  
Unity-Solana Wallet uses Solnet's implementation .NET SDK, but we had to modify the library to make it Unity compatible with .NET Standard 2.0 and .NET 4.x.
Solnet is Solana's .NET SDK to integrate with the .NET ecosystem.  [Solnet](https://blockmountain.io/Solnet/).

## Installation

1. Clone this repository outside of the main Unity project
2. Go to Package Manager in your project
3. Click on the plus in the top left corner and select "Add package from disk"
4. Select package.json file from a cloned dir
5. Once the package is installed, in the Package Manager inspector you will have Samples. Click on Import

## Step-by-step instructions
1. If you have an older version of Unity that doesn't have imported Newtonsoft.Json just import it.
2. After importing the wallet Unity will throw unity-plastic error. Just restart Unity.
3. Create a new scene.
4. Import WalletController prefab into your scene.
5. Set Client Source (Mainnet/Testnet/Devnet/Custom uri) and Storage Method (Json/Simple txt) on SimpleWallet script in WalletController prefab.
6. If you use custom URI be careful to use WS/WSS instead of HTTP/HTTPS because WebSocket does not work with HTTP / HTTPS.
7. To save mnemonics in JSON format, select the JSON storage method, and if you want to save it as a regular string, select Simple Txt.
8. If you want to use mnemonics saved in JSON format, you must deserialize it first. You have an example in ReGenerateAccountScreen.cs in the ResolveMnemonicsByType method.
9. Create new Canvas
10. Import WalletHolder prefab into the Canvas or if you want your design just import wallet prefab and customize the scene like we did with WalletHolder.

## Functionalities description
### Login Screen
- If you have already logged in to your wallet, then your mnemonics are stored and encrypted in memory with your password and you can log in with that password. Otherwise you have to create or restore a wallet.

### Create Wallet Screen
- You now have automatically generated mnemonics and to successfully create a wallet you must enter a password with which the mnemonics will be encrypted. I recommend that you use the Save Mnemonics option and save them to a text file. Then press create button to create a wallet.

### Regenerate Wallet Screen
- If you have saved mnemonics and want to recreate a wallet with it, load them by pressing Load Mnemonics button and generate the password again. Now your wallet is regenerated and the amount of SOL and NFT will be reloaded.

### Wallet Screen
- After you successfully logged in / generated / regenerated a wallet you will automatically be transferred to the wallet screen. Now you are shown SOL balance and your NFT's and you are automatically subscribed to the account via the websocket. This allows you to track changes in your account (automatic refreshing of SOL balance when a balance changes, etc..).

### Recieve Screen
- To facilitate testing, there is an Airdrop option in the Recieve section. Click on the Airdrop button, return to the Wallet Screen and wait a few seconds to see the change in SOL balance.

### Transfer Screen
- To complete the transaction enter the wallet pubkey and the amount you want to send. Then return to the wallet screen and wait a few seconds for the SOL Balance to refresh.

## Introduction to WalletBaseComponent.cs

public void DeleteWalletAndClearKey()
```
- Unsubscribe from WebSocket events
- Delete used wallet

### Start WebSocket connection
```C#
public void StartWebSocketConnection()
```
- Starts WebSocket connection when user is logged in.

## Introduction to WebsocketService.cs
- This class is located at Packages -> Solana Wallet -> Runtime -> UnityWebSocket -> WebSocketService.cs
### Start connection
```C#
public void StartConnection(string address)
```
- For WebSocket to work we must first create a connection calling StartConnection from WebSocketService.cs and forward address
- In this function we create new WebSocket, then subscribe to events and open WebSocket connection.
- Call example
```C#
 webSocketService.StartConnection(GetWebsocketConnectionURL(clientSource));
```
### Subscribe to wallet account events
```C#
 public void SubscribeToWalletAccountEvents(string pubKey)
```
- To subscribe Account on WebSocket events call function SubscribeToWalletAccountEvents and forward Wallet Pub key
- First set subscriptionTypeReference to know which event we are processing (in this case it is accountSubscribe).
- Then call SendParameter and forward parameter for account subscription.
- Call example 
```C#
 webSocketService.SubscribeToWalletAccountEvents(wallet.Account.GetPublicKey);
```
### Unsubscribe to wallet account events
```C#
 public void UnSubscribeToWalletAccountEvents()
```
- To unsubscribe Account from WebSocket events call function UnsubscribeToWalletAccountEvents
- First set subscriptionTypeReference to know which event we are processing (in this case it is accountUnsubscribe).
- Then call SendParameter and forward parameter for account unsubscription.
- Call example 
 ```C#
 public void StartWebSocketConnection()
 {
     if (webSocketService.Socket != null) return;

     webSocketService.StartConnection(GetWebsocketConnectionURL(clientSource));
 }
```
### On Message
 ```C#
 private void OnMessage(object sender, MessageEventArgs e)
```
- To respond to websocket events we use WebSocket actions that we call in OnMessage function
- Depending on the SubscriptionTypeReference, we deserialize the message into a model.
- Invoke WebSocketAction
- Then subscribe the desired functionality to the action
```C#
 WebSocketActions.WebSocketAccountSubscriptionAction += CheckSubscription;
```

### Close connection
```C#
 public void CloseConnection()
 {
     if (_socket == null) return;

     _socket.CloseAsync();
 }
```
-To close WebSocket connection call CloseConnection from WebSocketService.cs

## Introduction to Nft.cs

### Try get nft data
```C#
public static async Task<Nft> TryGetNftData(string mint, SolanaRpcClient connection, bool tryUseLocalContent = true)
```

- Call example 
```C#
Nft.Nft nft = await Nft.Nft.TryGetNftData(item.Account.Data.Parsed.Info.Mint, SimpleWallet.instance.activeRpcClient, true);
```
### Try load nft from local
```C#
public static Nft TryLoadNftFromLocal(string mint)

    if (nft != null)
    {
        return nft;
    }
}
```
### Create address
```C#
public static Solnet.Wallet.PublicKey CreateAddress(List<byte[]> seed, string programId)
```
- Create NFT's public key from seed and programId
- Call example
```C#
try
{
     seeds[3] = new[] { (byte)nonce };
     publicKey = CreateAddress(seeds, programId);
     return publicKey;
}
```

### Find program address
```C#
public static Solnet.Wallet.PublicKey FindProgramAddress(string mintPublicKey, string programId = "metaqbxxUerdq28cj1RbAWkYQm3ybzjb6a8bt518x1s")
```

- Call example 
```C#
Solnet.Wallet.PublicKey metaplexDataPubKey = FindProgramAddress(mint);
```
### Get metaplex Json data
